# HRSBallast: A high-resolution dataset featuring scanned angular, semi-angular and rounded railway ballast

## Data Description
A high-resolution dataset of digitally scanned railway ballast (HRSBallast) is presented, consisting of 108 individual, digitised samples. The ballast samples were sourced from both a railway test track section located on a heavy haul coal export line in South Africa and a local quarry. The sampled ballast from the field installation represent angular, semi-angular and rounded geometric features depending on the sampled location. The fresh ballast sourced from the quarry was iteratively tested using a hydraulic actuator in a small-scale box test which forms part of a separate research project. The ballast samples were scanned before and after every test to ascertain the changes in geometry, in addition to the loss of material due to attrition. The field and laboratory samples were digitised using a high-resolution, commercial (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) VSLAM-based scanner with a 40-micrometre accuracy. Samples which were fractured by the hydraulic actuator are also included in the dataset. HRSBallast serves as a reference dataset for granular media (GM) simulations utilizing DEM (discrete element method), degradation or wear modelling, digital assets for the creation of synthetic datasets for deep learning applications, embedded railway instrumentation and video games requiring high-resolution geometry.
